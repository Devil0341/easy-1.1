Easy Question #1
Write a function called productOfValues which takes in an object of key/value pairs and 
multiplies the values together. 
You can assume that all keys are strings and all values are integers.

let testObject = {
  'a': 5, 
  'b': 12,
  'c': 3
}

productOfValues(testObject) // should return 180 because 5 * 12 * 3 = 180
